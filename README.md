# 📚 lib2ran – Library Genesis Book Downloader

**lib2ran** is a  Python CLI tool I made from ChatGPT ( functionalities:: almost everything in the main code is copied and pasted from chatGPT ) -

This tool offers both **interactive** and **direct command-line** modes for maximum flexibility.
The website I am scraping books from [Library Genesis (libgen.rs)](https://libgen.rs).
